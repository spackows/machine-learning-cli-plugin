<!-- This template is for introducing a command-line interface (CLI). It is a reference template intended to document productive use of the CLI. It is not intended for task information. -->

<!-- Name your file `offering-cli-name.md`, for example, `auto-scaling-cli.md` is the file name of the Auto-Scaling CLI reference topic. Delete content examples and coding that you are not using for your offering. -->


# {{site.data.keyword.ibmwatson_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} CLI
<!-- Insert your CLI name into topic title above. -->
{: #machine-learning-cli}
<!-- Provide an appropriate ID above -->


<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a developer would want to use this cli. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include your offering's CLI name. Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.

Example: -->

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} CLI (plugin name: `machine-learning`) to train and deploy models, as well as manage objects in your repository from a command line on you computer.
{:shortdesc} 


<!-- Prerequisites/Authorization/Environment: OPTIONAL
The section should lists all the prerequisites/authorization/environment that are required to use the CLI commands. Or give a brief introduction to the prerequisites/authorization/environment that the CLI commands might use. Use **Note** to call out this section.
Example: -->

**Notes**
- Instructions for setting up the CLI on your local computer are here: [Setting up the CLI](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml_dlaas_environment.html)
- Explanations for key terms are here: [Terminology](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml-terminology.html)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

In May 2018, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI commands changed from `bluemix` and `bx` to `ibmcloud`. So, for example, the command `bx ml help` became `ibmcloud ml help`.  You can still use the `bluemix` and `bx` CLI commands until they are removed in the future.  If you have scripts that use the `bluemix` and `bx` commands, update those scripts to use `ibmcloud` (or consider other strategies, such as using command aliases.)
{: tip}

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- Commands index: REQUIRED
Use a table to list out all the commands in alphabetic order so that commands information is easy to scan and locate. Add a link to the anchor of each command.  
Use "<CLI_name> commands index" as the section title. 
Sort the command in alphabetic order from left to right across the columns in each row, and then by successive rows and columns.
Include no more than 5 columns for a table. 
If there are a great many commands, to make it easy to retrieve specific commands, you can add several index tables. Group the commands by functions or other similar characteristics, and then make each group a table, with the commands listed in alphabetic order across the columns in each row. 
Examples: -->


## {{site.data.keyword.ibmwatson_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} CLI commands index
{: #commands_index}

You can specify one of the following commands:

<table summary="Commands">
<caption>Table 1. Commands</caption>  
 <thead>
 <th colspan="5">Commands</th>
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
 <tr> 
 <td>[cancel](#cancel)</td>

<!-- Command entries: REQUIRED
Directly use the command name as title.  Add an anchor ID, for example, {: #login}, for each command entry, so that you can link to the command entry from the index table. Include a sentence to briefly introduce the command, such as what does this command do. 

Command syntax: Add the command syntax by using three backticks ahead of and after the syntax (```). 

Command prerequisites/authorization/environment: Prerequisites/authorization/environment that are required to use this command. Use the ** ** markup to highlight the word prerequisites/authorization/environment. 

Command Options: Use the ** ** markup markup to highlight the word "Command options". Use a definition list to introduce the options. Make one option one list item. 
				 
Examples: Use the ** ** markup to highlight the word "Examples".
          - Include one sentence to describe each example.
		   - Add the example by using three backticks ahead of and after the example (```)
		   - For copyable code snippet, multi-line, include {: codeblock} following the last set of backticks. A copy button will display in framework in output.
          - For copyable command, single line, include {: pre} following the last set of backticks. When displayed, it will show "$" at the beginning of the command example and a copy button, but the copy button will include just the command example.
 
Examples:

## login
{: #login}

Use this command to log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. 

```
cloud-cli login [userID] [pw]
```
**Prerequisites**: None.

**Command options**:
